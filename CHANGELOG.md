"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying,
'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold spiralArms white horse"
There'galacticNoise spiralArms man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be spiralArms golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around
